Welcome to Asteroid VR. Our unity based game was made to give users an immense VR experience while they're using the Oculus headset. We've allowed for asteroids travelling at relativley high speeds to be hurled directly at our users, giving them only their hands as their survival tool. This has been built for your entertainment and may recieve future updates.

Enjoy!
